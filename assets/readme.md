Title: Weather Dashboard

Description: A weather app that allows users to type in a city to look out for the:
i. Temprature
ii. Humidity
iii. wind
for 5 days

- I have been able to fetch an Api that displays the the weather for five days.

- When the user type the city and click it displays the city name and the weather condition

-When the user type in a wrong city. an alert is given to prompt the user to type in the right city.

- City would not populate when the search input feild is not field.

- When the the user types the city, a history button is created so the user can refer to it at any time.

-when any of the history button is clicked, the weather is populated in the display area

- The ap is responsive to mobile app as well using bootstrap.
